<body> If you are not familiar with what a Feis is here is some information. A Feis is an Irish Dance competetion that 
    has three judges. At these types of competitions dancers have the opportunity to become a a champion level dancer. 
    They are typically bigger than one judge competitions which are called <b>Feilie's </b>. When a dance is over at these 
    competitions the judges ring a bell which is what ends a dance.

<h1>Covid 19 Impact</h1>

<body>Covid19 left a huge impact on the competive Irish Dancing world. With the inability to me in person to dance, the Feis world
    switched to going <b> virual.</b> They began holding virual Feises where dancers would sumbit videos of their dancing from home.
Which are then watched by judges online.  </body>

<Body>Below is a video of a dancer creating a film to sumbit for an online Feis. This was filmed in her basement which 
    is what she had acess to dance in during this time.
